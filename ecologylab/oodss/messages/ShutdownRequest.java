 * A message indicating that the server should shut down it's associated
 * application. Before the shutdown sequence is complete, the server should
 * respond to the client.
 * 
 * Generally, the response should be an OkResponse, indicating that the server
 * has complied and is beginning the shutdown sequence. An ErrorResponse
 * generally means that the server does not support this message.
 * 
 * Subclasses could have the server return certain data before shutting down,
 * such as a log file.
